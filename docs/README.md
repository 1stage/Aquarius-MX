## To-Be Completed
- **Aquarius MX Quick-Start Guide:** How to get up and running quickly with your new Aquarius MX.
- **How to Build an Aquarius MX:** A complete guide on how to source parts and build your own Aquarius MX. This will probably be released on YouTube before a printed guide is complete.
- **USB BASIC Commands:** A supplement to the original Aquarius Users Guide (Guide to Home Computing) that shows how to use the newly added USB BASIC commands.

## Logo Usage Recommendations
- **Keep it in proportion** - Maintain the proper proportions of the Aquarius MX logo. Don't squash or stretch the logo to fill empty space. In most design/layout applications, this means dragging to resize the logo from the CORNER points, not the sides.
- **Colors Matter** - Don't change the colors of the logo to suit your needs. Keep the BLUE the same color blue, and don't change the COLOR version of the logo to modify the rainbow colors in the "Q".
- **Black on White** - If a single-ink/color usage is needed, use the "BW" version of the logo on light color paper/backgrounds in BLACK ink. Otherwise, use the "WHITE" version of the logo on dark color paper/backgrounds in WHITE ink.
- **Don't Make it Your Own** - Don't alter the design of the logo, or add your own branding to it that intrudes within an area closer than 10% of the height or width of the border of the logo. The logo is for EVERYONE to use as a "standard".
