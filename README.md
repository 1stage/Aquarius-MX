## Overview
The Aquarius MX system expander brings USB compatibility to the Aquarius Computer along with a 32K RAM expansion, and features all the functionality of Bruce Abbott's Micro Expander in an easy-to-build solution that fits the footprint of the Mini Expander.

## Features
- **USB Drive Port** - Reads and writes to USB drive, for quick access to games and programs
- **32k RAM** - Removes the need for a separate RAM expansion cartridge
- **Cartridge ROM Loading** - Quick loading/running of legacy Aquarius ROM cartridges through USB
- **AY-3-8910 Sound Chip** - Three voice PSG (Programmable Sound Generator) with Control Pad IO
- **PT3 Music Player** - Built-in retro music player
- **Aquarius Control Pad Inputs** - Standard DB9 connectors for attaching Aquarius Control Pads (internal header also available)
- **USB BASIC** - Enhanced commands for USB and IO devices to improve your BASIC programs
- **Classic Design** - Matches original Aquarius design aesthetic, in a device the same size as the Mini Expander: 210mm x 120mm x 55mm / 8.5" x 4.75" x 2.125"
- **Easy to Build** - Using standard through-hole components, this is an easy-to-make project for those who like to tinker in electronics
- **Open Source** - All components of this project are open source: make or modify them to your heart's content
- **Expandable** - System expansion port availble for future add-ons
