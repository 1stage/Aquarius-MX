## Real Time Clock
### System Variables
The 24 bytes of RAM between Screen RAM and Color RAM and the 24 bytes
between the end of Color RAM and System Variables are used as temporary
variables by the RTC and DateTime Routines
These areas are overwritten when the screen is cleared via PRINT CHR$(11)
### Implementing Real Time Clock in Emulators
The will be a read from memory location $37F0 whenever the RTC is accessed
If $37F0 contains $7F, the RTC is being written to and the following
bytea contain the date to be written.
If $37F0 contains any other value, the RTC was just read and $37F0 should
be filled with $FF and the following bytes with the current date/time.
See the RTC driver file for the date/time structure.
