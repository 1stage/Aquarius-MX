## Register Usage
### IX
- Used in module windows.asm to point to the window structure.
  - Should not conflict with usage in MX BASIC, as the module is never used from within BASIC itself
- Used in MX BASIC by the UDF Hook call and dispatch routines and the statement and function dispatch routines.
- Can be used as a temporary variable in any routine
  - Assume that it will be changes by CALLs to most BASIC system routines
### IY
- Used in the debuggers.
  - Should not conflist with usage in MX BASIC, as the debuggers save all the registers when handling a Break
- Used in dos.asm to point to the system variable DosFlags
  - Can be used as variable that persists through any BASIC statement handling routine.
- Do *not* use as a temporary variable in any subroutines that may be called by a statement handler.

## Real Time Clock
### System Variables
The 24 bytes of RAM between Screen RAM and Color RAM and the 24 bytes
between the end of Color RAM and System Variables are used as temporary
variables by the RTC and DateTime Routines
These areas are overwritten when the screen is cleared via PRINT CHR$(11)
### Implementing Real Time Clock in Emulators
The will be a read from memory location $37F0 whenever the RTC is accessed
If $37F0 contains $7F, the RTC is being written to and the following
bytea contain the date to be written.
If $37F0 contains any other value, the RTC was just read and $37F0 should
be filled with $FF and the following bytes with the current date/time.
See the RTC driver file for the date/time structure.
